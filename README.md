# CSS Grid demo samples
This is my demo project used for presentation about CSS Grid for developers. 

## Bootstrap sample
Kinda holy grail layout using bootstrap. This example is purely used to demonstrate the markap verbosity of creating such layout using bootstrap, or similar UI frameworks.

## Grid sample
This example shows how to acheive the same holy grail layout using CSS Grid. Elements are positioned using line numbers.

## Areas sample
The same layout as in above two, but this time using CSS Grid Areas for positioning elements in rows and columns.

## Responsive sample
Again, the same layout as above, but this time it is made responsive (for three different screen widths) using media queries.

## Responsive #2
This sample shows how to acheive simple but fully responsive layout by setting just few CSS Grid properties.

## Feature query sample
This sample shows how CSS Grid can is supposed to override old fashion way of layout like float. Floating is automatically overriden with CSS Grid in browsers where it is supported. Usually it is needed to use feature queries to detect certain feature and override width and marging.

## Auto placement sample
Sample of CSS Grid auto placement algorithm with dense packing mode

## World map
Another sample of CSS Grid areas with ASCII art applied

## Overlay
Another sample of CSS Grid layout with overlay layer. Layaring is done by using z-index.
